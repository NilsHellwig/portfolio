          I am a {new Date().getFullYear() - 2000 - (new Date().getMonth() > 5 || (new Date().getMonth() === 5 && new Date().getDate() >= 6) ? 0 : 1)}-year-old PhD candidate and software engineer based in Regensburg, Germany. I am currently pursuing my doctoral degree at the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Regensburg, where I specialize in Natural Language Processing and computational linguistics.

          My research focuses on advancing LLM-based approaches to tackle aspect-based sentiment analysis in low-resource scenarios. I have published multiple papers in conferences and journals, exploring topics such as synthetic training data generation, transformer-based sentiment analysis, and the application of LLMs for complex NLP tasks.

          Beyond my academic work in NLP, I am passionate about full-stack software engineering. I develop modern web applications using technologies like Next.js, React, TypeScript, and MongoDB for various projects. I enjoy building scalable, user-friendly solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications.
