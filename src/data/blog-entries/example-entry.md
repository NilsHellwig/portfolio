# Introduction to React

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

## Key Features of React

### 1. Component-Based

React allows you to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

### 2. Declarative

React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

### 3. Learn Once, Write Anywhere

You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## Getting Started with React

To get started with React, you can use Create React App, a comfortable environment for learning React and a way to start building a new single-page application.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
