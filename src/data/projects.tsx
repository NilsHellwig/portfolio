The central idea behind WhistleTube revolves around an infinite number of chatrooms. Each chatroom has a unique "Tube ID", allowing anyone to join the conversations. All messages are permanently stored in a MongoDB database. To facilitate real-time chat, I implemented socket.io. User authentication is handled using JWT tokens. On the frontend, Vue.js (specifically, Vite) was used in conjunction with Tailwind for a smooth and responsive user interface. While the project is not currently publicly accessible via a URL, I have plans to make further updates and improvements. I enjoy using the application with my friends and am excited about enhancing its features.',

These catalogs serve various purposes, such as curating collections of favorite games. Originally designed as a web application primarily for mobile devices, users can easily add the app to their home screens for a seamless full-screen experience. Looking ahead, there is potential for a transition into a native app format (apk/ipa), with Apache Cordova being a viable option. It's worth noting that while the application was developed using Cordova, the primary focus was on functionality rather than content creation—texts were generated using GPT-2, and images were sourced from Pexels/Pixabay.
